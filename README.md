# Statlog-Heart-Disease-Prediction
A system that can classify the absence (1) or presence (2) of heart disease (binary classification) using the Statlog (Heart) Data Set

This is the assignment from the Machine Learning class, Inha University. Maybe someone will find it useful for his project or assignment.

The task was as follows: Part2: classification
1. Implement a system that can classify the absence (1) or presence (2) of heart disease (binary classification) using the following Dataset
The full dataset is available here (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29)
2. Apply 5 classification algorithms (Logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, K-nn) to evaluate the algorithms using the following metrics( accuracy, precision, recall, and F1)
3. Try to conduct the same classification task mentioned above but after you do preprocessing for data using PCA and compare the results.  ( classification with PCA vs. classification without PCA) [Bonus]
4. You can open the dataset file “heart.dat” using notepad then convert it to any format you want.
